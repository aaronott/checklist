The following is a list of "Features" some are obviously more important than others
but I need a list of them somewhere so I know what still needs to be worked on

- Export as PDF
- Report template
- Persist single session (this simply means save an active report and have the
   ability to bring it back up later.)

- Add + button. This will allow users to add more findings to each section.
- save text from input boxes

- Remove session files on close.
  - test to see if the session has been saved.

- When using 'New' from the menu, test to see if session has been saved.
  - Also need to refresh the screen. (possibly create an index.html for initialization purposes)

- Finish initializeSession to handle the Open file situation.

# Saving should export the content, the templates, and the database

-- Save is working.

### Still todo in save.
  - check to see if file already exists and ask if it should be overwritten.
  - save as same name if already saved.
