The following is a list of "Features" some are obviously more important than others
but I need a list of them somewhere so I know what still needs to be worked on

- Export as PDF
- Report template
- Persist single session (this simply means save an active report and have the
   ability to bring it back up later.)


# Saving should export the content, the templates, and the database
